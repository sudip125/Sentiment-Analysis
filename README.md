# IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive Reviews or negative Reviews by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization

What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of data science that focuses on teaching computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.It is important in data science because it enables computers to process and analyze large amounts of unstructured text data, such as social media posts and customer reviews.So it is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis.

About Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to identify, extract and analyze the emotional tone of a piece of text. It involves identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text as either positive, negative, or neutral (In this dataset there is Positive and Negative only). Sentiment analysis is commonly used in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. It can help businesses understand how customers perceive their brand, products, and services, and can be used to improve customer experience and inform marketing strategies.

How does it work?

Simply you can see on below reel video there is a form which take any language movie review text data from you. Insite the app I use Google API to translate your text data into English because my app work on English review (IMDB dataset also in English form). After that you can hit the predict button, My app model predict you review and give you the result. It give either Positive  or Negative.It also show that which language you type on form and translate into English with the help of Google API.

## Why we need Sentiment Analysis

Imagine you are willing to watch great movie on Youtube or other platform(amazon prime,netflix etc). How can you select best movie for you?? I think you are looking reviews of other people (you can say comment). Imagine the reviews are so long or In other language you can't understand. So here comes the Sentiment Analysis it gives you the result what actually that comment was positive or negative. From that you can decide, you should watch this movie or not. It is just example for you. It can use different way you can't imagine like sentiment analysis can help businesses make data-driven decisions by providing insights into customer opinions, brand reputation, marketing effectiveness, and industry trends.


## Important of Sentiment Analysis

Here are some reasons why sentiment analysis is important:

1. Understand customer opinions and feedback: By analyzing the sentiment of customer feedback, businesses can gain insights into how their customers feel about their products or services. This can help them identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about product development and customer service.

2. Monitor brand reputation: Sentiment analysis can help businesses monitor their brand reputation by analyzing online conversations about their brand. This can help them identify potential issues and respond to negative comments in a timely manner.

3. Improve marketing campaigns: By analyzing the sentiment of social media conversations about their brand or industry, businesses can gain insights into how their target audience feels about certain topics. This can help them create more targeted and effective marketing campaigns.

4. Track industry trends: Sentiment analysis can help businesses stay up-to-date with industry trends by analyzing social media conversations about their industry. This can help them identify emerging trends and adapt their business strategies accordingly.
## IMDB Datasets

The IMDB movie review dataset is a collection of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), which is a popular online database of information related to movies, TV shows, and other entertainment content. The dataset is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) research and machine learning projects, particularly for sentiment analysis tasks.

The dataset is split into two sets of 25,000 reviews each - one for training and one for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative based on the star rating given by the reviewer. The dataset is evenly split between positive and negative reviews, and the reviews are preprocessed and encoded in UTF-8 format.

The IMDB movie review dataset is widely used for research and development in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. It has been used to develop and test algorithms for sentiment analysis, text classification, and other NLP tasks. The dataset is available for download from various sources, including the official IMDB website and academic research repositories.you can download the dataset form below link.

## Which ML Algorithm is used

This dataset is classification problem so you can use below Algorithm:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Neural Networks
6. Naive Bayes

- To choose the best classification algorithm in machine learning, it's important to understand the problem, evaluate multiple algorithms, consider the complexity of the algorithm, check for assumptions, and consider interpretability.

In my project I used Naive Bayes algorithm because it give 92+ accuracy which is more than other algorithm and my dataset is binary classification problem.

### Naive Bayes :

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm in machine learning that is based on Bayes' theorem. It is a simple yet effective algorithm that is commonly used in text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and other applications.

The basic idea behind Naive Bayes is to calculate the probability of a new data point belonging to each class, based on its feature values. It assumes that the features are independent of each other, which is often not true in practice, but can still yield good results in many cases.

To classify a new data point, the algorithm first calculates the prior probability of each class based on the frequency of each class in the training data. It then calculates the likelihood of the features given each class, which involves estimating the conditional probability of each feature value given the class. Finally, it uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of each class, given the new data point's feature values. The class with the highest posterior probability is chosen as the predicted class for the new data point.

One of the main advantages of Naive Bayes is that it is simple and computationally efficient, requiring only a small amount of memory and processing power. It can also handle high-dimensional data with many features, and is often used in applications where interpretability is important, as the algorithm produces easily interpretable results.

Naive Bayes is a useful classification algorithm that can produce accurate results in many applications, particularly in text and categorical data classification tasks.



## Conclusion about Project
From the above file and folder you can also build this Project and test the model. It is not necessary to follow my step what I done.You can create you own step. Necessary and important is that how does it work and how it is build in. There are many algorithm we should know how to choose the algorithm and other multiple step are there which should you know. Thank you☺️☺️☺️

### Best of luck for your Project
